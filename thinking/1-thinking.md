## Thinking Through Heidegger

<blockquote class="epigraph">Truth is “the goddess,” θεά. Her house is well rounded, not closed, never (trembling) dissembling heart but, instead, disclosing illumination of everything.[^1] <footer>Martin Heidegger</footer></blockquote>

The following is an attempt to put my own thoughts on Heidegger, my 'evaluation'
of his work, into writing. There will be few cited references to secondary
texts, but this shouldn't be taken as an indication that my thoughts are wholly
unique: they are, inevitably, informed by interpreters of Heidegger, but in this
writing I am not aiming to faithfully reconstruct the work of any of those
interpreters.

To start with -- how are we to read Heidegger? It would be wrong to read all
works of philosophy as mere autobiography; however, it would also be wrong to
project a philosopher out of concrete human life and suggest that they were
immune from letting their life enter into their thought. Heidegger himself
writes:

> Regarding the personality of a philosopher, our only interest is that he was
> born at a certain time, that he worked, and that he died. The character of the
> philosopher, and issues of that sort, will not be addressed here.[^2]

Here, he either forgets or ignores that the thinking of a philosopher -- the
fact 'that he worked' -- *is* an 'issue of character'. The work of a philosopher
is an attempt to *overcome* oneself; it is the concrete particulars of human
life that provoke thought, and it is the task of thought to find the universal
in these particulars. This is why studying philosophy is equivalent to studying
the history of philosophy: our task is to recognise the tension, the dialectical
relationship, between a philosopher’s life and their thought.

In trying to overcome themselves (their finitude, contingency -- their life)
through philosophy, the philosopher's thought both *is* and is *not* their life.

Importantly, and for this reason, it is wrong to speak of 'the racism problem in
Kant', or 'the fascism problem in Heidegger'. The moral-political 'problem' is
not separable from the philosophical problem of the thinker as a whole; thus
there is only *'the Kant problem'*, or *'the Heidegger problem'*, and so on, in
which questions of racism or fascism arise. In separating the life-problems of
a thinker from their philosophical work, one has already assumed that the
thinker was able to successfully and entirely overcome their life through
philosophy. (In general, the incessant division of philosophy into 'topics' or
'issues' is a bad sign.)

### Against Dasein {#against}

I understand Heidegger's project to be calling for a kind of awakening. In the
exergue to *Being and Time*, he invokes the Platonic theme of forgetting: we
have *forgotten* the meaning of being. Moreover, he claims, we have forgotten
even to be *perplexed* by our forgetting! What is perplexion or confusion? It is
the affect that arises when one possesses some vague idea of something; an idea
which is so buried over, so neutralised and disguised as 'common sense', that it
is no longer meaningfully questionable. Insofar as *Being and Time* works
towards *asking the question of the meaning of being*, therefore, it sees
Heidegger pushing us intentionally toward confusion. As such, the 'awakening' I
find in Heidegger's work is an awakening to confusion: more than he wants to
defend any particular position, or demonstrate any particular proposition,
Heidegger wants his readers (and, really, 'the West' as a whole) to face
themselves up to a *mystery*: namely, 'the one mystery' of being itself.[^3]

'Dasein' enters Heidegger's work early on, as the being for whom the awakening
is possible: Dasein is the only entity for whom being is an issue, and thus it
is only Dasein who can face up to the mystery of being. Insofar as Heidegger
talks about the 'meaning' of being, it would seem that he must consider the
being *for whom* things are meaningful; this is why, in my judgment, his project
begins with a focus on Dasein. The mistake of so much scholarship on Heidegger
is to subsequently take Dasein as the central concept for *all* of Heidegger's
work, and thus reduce Heidegger to a theorist of social relations (Dreyfus), a
quasi-Kantian transcendental critic (Carman), or a strange philosopher for whom
being and meaningfulness (or 'intelligibility') are the same thing (Sheehan).
This is a profoundly misguided reading which, it seems to me, is founded upon
the false assumption that *Being and Time* is the apex of Heidegger's work,
rather than the introduction to his project. In defence of my reading, we need
only look again to the exergue to *Being and Time*:

> ...are we nowadays even perplexed at our inability to understand the
> expression 'being'? Not at all. So first of all we must reawaken an
> understanding for the meaning of this question. The aim of the following
> treatise is to work out the question of the meaning of *"being"* and to do so
> concretely. The provisional aim is the interpretation of *time* as the
> possible horizon for any understanding whatsoever of being.[^4]

Here, in the very first sentences, Heidegger is explicit that his book is only
an *opening*, wherein a question is asked: namely, the question 'what does
"being" mean?' He is not asking what Dasein means, and it is evident throughout
the book that the analysis of Dasein -- which, after all, is an analysis of *us*
-- is simply a way of opening us up to the mystery of being. In this way, *Being
and Time* is something of a transcendental work, in the Kantian sense of the
term. There are multiple ways for Heidegger (in *Being and Time*) in which
*Dasein* must be interpreted before being itself can be understood. I take these
to be the two central aspects of this interpretation:

1. Dasein has a preontological understanding of being: '*Seinsverständnis ist
   selbst eine Seinsebestimmtheit des Daseins*'. This serves as a starting point
   for the being-question, which can be properly asked when Dasein's
   preontological understanding is properly developed: 'the question of being is
   nothing else than the radicalization of an essential tendency of being that
   belongs to Dasein itself, namely, of the pre-ontological understanding of
   being'.[^5]
2. Dasein is always at risk of distorting or covering up its understanding of
   being, thanks to the natural proclivity toward *idle talk*: a form of discourse
   wherein Dasein conceals its own being (its being-in-the-world) under the
   comfort of everyday chatter. In its idle talk, Dasein 'holds any new
   questioning [e.g. of being] and discussion at a distance because it presumes
   it has understood, and in a peculiar way it suppresses them and holds them
   back'.[^6]

Put this way, the early Heidegger is not nearly as radical as he will become: is
there not a close similarity between Heidegger's laying the ground of the
being-question through an interpretation of Dasein, and Kant's laying the ground
of critical metaphysics through an interpretation of the transcendental ego? I
don't mean to suggest that Dasein *is* the transcendental ego -- it is not an
ego at all -- but that the broad gestures of *Being and Time* still remain
largely within the tradition of Western metaphysics. Indeed, William Richardson
-- the only Anglo-American Heidegger scholar to receive Heidegger's explicit
approval -- characterises *Being and Time* in the following way:

> Heidegger's purpose is to *lay the groundwork for metaphysics* by seeking to
> discern that ontological structure of man which is the source of his natural
> tendency to metaphysicize. Since metaphysics deals with Being structures and
> the metaphysician is intrinsically finite, the problem becomes an effort to
> explain *the relation between Being and finitude*. Solution: the comprehension
> of Being as such is intrinsically finite. The function of SZ is to discern
> phenomenologically this finite comprehension of Being and reveal its ultimate
> sense.[^7]

Laying the groundwork for metaphysics... the relation between Being and
finitude... these are undoubtedly classical themes in Western philosophy. It is
for this reason that I take the role of *Being and Time* (and its core concept
of Dasein) in Heidegger's complete corpus to be akin to Wittgenstein's metaphor
of a ladder: *Being and Time* awakens us, hopefully, to the mystery of being
(the discovery of the ontological difference is enough to do this, really), but
it is ultimately to be discarded once the reader recognises it as caught up
within a metaphysical tradition which, for Heidegger, is ultimately to be
overcome.

Now, Heidegger also refers to 'the interpretation of *time*' as part of the
question-asking; this, too, is an element of his work that undergoes a lot of
change as he moves away from Dasein. Time in *Being and Time*, compared to later
writings, is reasonably small-scale: time is the horizon of being insofar as it
limits Dasein's possibilities and conditions the meaningfulness of ready-to-hand
beings. Eventually, Heidegger comes to focus not on the history of *beings*, but
of being itself: all of history, Heidegger will claim, has progressed via the
succession of being disclosing itself in various ways. As he writes in 1942,
'"Time" in *Being and Time* is not the last but, instead, the first step of the
passageway into the transition to the truth of beyng, the transition necessary
for the history of beyng.'[^8] Yet again, it is made clear that *Being and
Time*, and the analysis of Dasein, was merely a stepping-stone, a preliminary
moment in our opening to the mystery of being.

### From Phenomenology to Gelassenheit {#ways}

So, how is the being-question asked? And -- of course we must also ask this --
what is its answer? As countless introductions to Heidegger have noted, the
issue(s) of ontology first arose in his life when he was gifted a copy of Franz
Brentano's book, *On the Manifold Sense of Being in Aristotle* (1862). Brentano
uses a crucial phrase from Aristotle as the epigraph to his book: τὸ ὂν λέγεται
πολλαχῶς. Heidegger translates this as 'Das Seiende wird (nämlich hinsichtlich
seines Seins) in vielfacher Weise offenkundig'. *That which is becomes manifest
(with regard to its being) in many ways*. This notion, which Heidegger stays
true to throughout his whole career, is manifest in his work in two ways:

1. Ways of being: just like Aristotle, Heidegger recognises that there are
   different ways or modes of being. For Aristotle, these are fourfold:
   accidental being, being as truth, being as potentiality or actuality, and
   categorial being. Heidegger does not enumerate the modes of being, but in
   *Being and Time* introduces *Zuhandenheit* and *Vorhandenheit* as two central
   modes of the being of non-Dasein entities.
2. 'Ways, not works': this phrase of Heidegger's is given at the beginning of
   the Gesamtausgabe, and is a partial explanation of the constant changes in
   Heidegger's voice. For as long as his questioning is directed toward *being*,
   which 'is manifest in many ways', so too must Heidegger's thought be directed
   in many ways.

We can accordingly formulate the being-question as: what is it that unifies all
the manifold ways of being? Heidegger's project -- when it is successful --
expresses the answer to this question in manifold ways.

The first two elements of Heidegger's **questioning** are *phenomenology* and
*the ontological difference*. (The latter, I would argue, is the central concept
in Heidegger's career, if we must claim that there is such a thing). Heidegger
inherited phenomenology from Husserl, but he was not quite so ambitious with it;
while, for Husserl, phenomenology 'was elaborated into a distinctive
philosophical position according to a pattern set by Descartes, Kant and
Fichte', for the early Heidegger its primary purpose was as a clue for engaging
the being-question.[^9] Phenomenology is the λόγος of φαίνεσθαι: it is the
manifesting of that-which-shows-itself. As Heidegger writes in *Being and Time*,
the "being true" of λόγος is always ἀλήθεια: un-concealing.  Phenomenology, as
the λόγος of phenomena, must 'take beings [that are manifest] out of their
concealment; to let them be seen as something unconcealed (ἀληθές); to
*discover* them'.[^10]

The ontological difference is what makes Heidegger's work so revolutionary (and
also difficult). It is an observation that is easy to state but difficult to
comport one's thinking around. The 'doctrine' of ontological difference states
that *there is a difference between beings and being itself*. In other words,
'being' -- that which qualifies things *as things* -- is not itself a thing. It
would be a grave error to hear this and subsequently render Heidegger as a kind
of Platonist, for whom every thing is indebted in its essence to something more
universal; for, in Plato, the forms or ideas are still, nonetheless, things.
Indeed -- and here is the radical core of Heidegger's thinking -- the fact that
being is not *a being* is what makes it completely elusive to the realm of
propositional or definitional discourse: as Pascal had already realised, 'One
cannot undertake to define being without falling into this absurdity; for one
cannot define a word without beginning in this way: *"It is ..."*'[^11]

These primary philosophical elements of Heidegger's -- phenomenology and the
ontological difference -- are united to reveal the precise way in which the
being-question is to be **answered:** not by asserting a proposition or a
definition, which would remain trapped in the ontic sphere (i.e. the sphere of
beings, things, entities), but to *let* being be *unconcealed* to us. Throughout
all of Heidegger's 'ways, not works', it is this strategy, I argue, that remains
ever-present. When he makes use of the concept of *Gelassenheit* in his later
work, for instance, we still see the motif of *letting* [*lassen*] being *be*.
When he increases his focus on poetry in the thirties, he is consciously aware
of the capacity of poetic language to *let things be*, and allow a world to come
into unconcealment. This is illustrated well by Angelus Silesius's poem, which
Heidegger was so fond of:

> *The rose is without 'why';<br>
> It blooms simply because it blooms;<br>
> It pays no attention to itself,<br>
> Nor does it ask whether anyone sees it.*

As I understand it, this recurring approach in Heidegger's thinking -- for
which, in my view, the term *Gelassenheit* serves as a useful synecdoche (along
with the linguistic concept of the middle voice) -- is the inevitable
consequence of thinking the ontological difference. That is to say, it is the
inevitable outcome of Heidegger's orientation at the outset.  Ordinary language
(which Heidegger is so hostile towards, along with most other facets of 'common
sense') is overwhelmingly 'ontic': to speak or write in a representational
register is to rely on subjects, predicates, and an infinity of *things*,
without any regard for the *being* of those things. It is no wonder that Carnap
had to entirely reject Heidegger's writing about *das Nichts*: as Hegel
recognised over a century prior to Carnap and Heidegger, 'the nothing' (as well
as being itself) is no-thing, i.e., no entity. The alternative mode of thinking
that remains is to eschew all common sense and, instead, work in an often poetic
register, a state of Gelassenheit, hoping that language will not 'present' but
'reveal' the truth of being, as though we, the thinkers, are bestowed with a
gift.

### Being-Historical Thinking

The failure of the entire history of philosophy, according to Heidegger, is its
self-entrapment within *ontotheology*. This word gained its first notable use in
Kant, who also used it disparagingly, but it takes on an entirely new meaning in
Heidegger's work. In his middle and later writings, Heidegger accuses all metaphysical thinking of operating in a twofold manner: a twofold way of
avoiding the being-question. Instead of looking for the 'meaning' or 'truth' of
being, Heidegger explains, metaphysics has looked to explain two ontic
phenomena: (1) the *essence* of things (their 'whatness'), and (2) the
*existence* of things as a whole (their 'thatness'). These two investigations
constitute the 'onto' and 'theo' of ontotheology; as Heidegger writes in *Kant's
Thesis About Being*,

> [Metaphysics] asks on the one hand: What are beings, in general, as beings?
> Considerations within the province of this question come, in the course of the
> history of philosophy, under the heading of ontology. The question "What are
> beings?" includes also the question, "Which being is the highest and in what
> way is it?" The question is about the divine and God. The province of this
> question is called theology.[^12]

For Heidegger, therefore, it is no coincidence that Western metaphysics is
abound with dualisms: essence-existence, content-form, and so on.[^13] These
dualisms are simply manifestations of metaphysics' twofold operation, and they
all show a dedication to ground metaphysics in some transhistorical presence, in
some entity that is somehow prior to, or more fundamental than, all others. As
Heidegger writes in his *Contributions to Philosophy*,

> The more exclusively thinking turns toward beings and seeks for itself a
> foundation that *is* most eminently (cf. Descartes and the modern era), all
> the more decisively does philosophy withdraw from the truth of beyng.[^14]

When Heidegger carries out his critique of ontotheology, from the 1930s until
the end of his life, he will conversely look to the *history* of being. In the
earlier work, Heidegger acknowledged the historical temporality of beings
(including Dasein). From the thirties and onwards, therefore, he envisions this
earlier work as too metaphysical, since its concern lay with the historicity of
beings, rather than the history of being itself. The historicising of ontology
is really what constitutes the 'turning' that his thought is said to have
undergone.

Let's look at this turning, step-by-step. *Being and Time* is published in 1927,
and is followed by *Kant und das Problem der Metaphysik* in 1929. The latter is,
more or less, a continuation of the former's project: Heidegger reads Kant as
laying the ground for metaphysics. In July of 1930, he gives a lecture entitled
'On the Essence of Truth', in which he claims that the essence of truth is found
in 'letting beings be'.[^15] In a later note on this essay, he admits that, in
*Being and Time*, 'thinking apparently remains on the pass of metaphysics'.[^16]
The lecture on truth sees the first suggestion of a movement away from Dasein
and toward being itself -- namely, being as truth or ἀλήθεια.

In April 1933, Heidegger was chosen as the rector of Freiburg university, and he
joined the Nazi party less than two weeks later. By this time, he was already
denouncing an 'international Jewish conspiracy' to his friends (such as Karl
Jaspers), and endorsing the Nazi government's anti-Semitic activity. In my view,
the Rectoral Address that Heidegger gave in this year is of particular use to
us: it not only reveals the nature of his nazism, not only introduces his turn
to historical thinking, but also suggests that these two phenomena might be
linked. The Address does not contain reference to 'the Führer', 'Hitler', or
even 'National Socialism'; however, it contains frequent reference to '*our*
Dasein', and the historical 'fate of the German people'.[^17] For Heidegger, the
university is an essential component of a state that wishes to assert itself;
the role of university education is to 'educate and discipline the leaders and
guardians of the fate of the German people' by reaching self-knowledge through
an examination of 'the essence of science'.[^18] It is in this context, I argue,
that his turn to historical thinking comes about; he himself makes an explicit
link between historico-philosophical thinking and the 'science' that allows for
a German 'Volk' to assert itself:

> But if there is to be science, and if it is to be *for* us and *through* us,
> under what conditions can it then truly exist?

> Only if we again place ourselves under the power of the *beginning* of our
> spiritual-historical being [*Dasein*]. This beginning is the setting out of
> Greek philosophy. Here, for the first time, western man raises himself up from
> a popular base and, by virtue of his language, stands up to the *totality of
> what is*, which he questions and conceives as the being that it is.[^19]

There is a lot to be said about this declaration. Firstly, the middle-voiced
tendency in Heidegger -- the spirit of *Gelassenheit* -- is evident in his
depiction of science working '*through* us', and of the people placing
themselves 'under the power of' their Dasein. Secondly, Heidegger is here
explicit in saying that in order to 'stand up to' being, 'western man' must
traverse back to the 'beginning', in Greek philosophy. He will later write
extensively on *der andere Anfang* (the other beginning), which for him marks
the future of philosophy after its renewal of *der erste Anfang* (the first
beginning) in Greek philosophy. I would suggest that this is not just naïve
eurocentrism, but in fact a deliberate philosophical gesture that coincides with
Heidegger's growing fascist politics. Is it a mere coincidence that Heidegger's
calls for a new beginning of thought, informed by the first beginning in ancient
Greece, come at the same time as the Nazis' call for a revolutionary new
beginning in European society? Could it be that Heidegger's turn to historical
thinking was in some way informed by, or paying service to, the Nazi conception
of 'fate' and revolution?
