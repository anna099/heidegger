<hr />
<p>The following is an attempt to put my own thoughts on Heidegger, my ‘evaluation’ of his work, into writing. There will be few cited references to secondary texts, but this shouldn’t be taken as an indication that my thoughts are wholly unique: they are, inevitably, informed by interpreters of Heidegger, but in this writing I am not aiming to faithfully reconstruct the work of any of those interpreters.</p>
<p>To start with – how are we to read Heidegger? It would be wrong to read all works of philosophy as mere autobiography; however, it would also be wrong to project a philosopher out of concrete human life and suggest that they were immune from letting their life enter into their thought. Heidegger himself writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Regarding the personality of a philosopher, our only interest is that he was born at a certain time, that he worked, and that he died. The character of the philosopher, and issues of that sort, will not be addressed here.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here, he either forgets or ignores that the thinking of a philosopher – the fact ‘that he worked’ – <em>is</em> an ‘issue of character’. The work of a philosopher is an attempt to <em>overcome</em> oneself; it is the concrete particulars of human life that provoke thought, and it is the task of thought to find the universal in these particulars. This is why studying philosophy is equivalent to studying the history of philosophy: our task is to recognise the tension, the dialectical relationship, between a philosopher’s life and their thought.</p>
<p>In trying to overcome themselves (their finitude, contingency – their life) through philosophy, the philosopher’s thought both <em>is</em> and is <em>not</em> their life.</p>
<p>Importantly, and for this reason, it is wrong to speak of ‘the racism problem in Kant’, or ‘the fascism problem in Heidegger’. The moral-political ‘problem’ is not separable from the philosophical problem of the thinker as a whole; thus there is only <em>‘the Kant problem’</em>, or <em>‘the Heidegger problem’</em>, and so on, in which questions of racism or fascism arise. In separating the life-problems of a thinker from their philosophical work, one has already assumed that the thinker was able to successfully and entirely overcome their life through philosophy. (In general, the incessant division of philosophy into ‘topics’ or ‘issues’ is a bad sign.)</p>
<hr />
<p>I understand Heidegger’s project to be calling for a kind of awakening. In the exergue to <em>Being and Time</em>, he invokes the Platonic theme of forgetting: we have <em>forgotten</em> the meaning of being. Moreover, he claims, we have forgotten even to be <em>perplexed</em> by our forgetting! What is perplexion or confusion? It is the affect that arises when one possesses some vague idea of something; an idea which is so buried over, so neutralised and disguised as ‘common sense’, that it is no longer meaningfully questionable. Insofar as <em>Being and Time</em> works towards <em>asking the question of the meaning of being</em>, therefore, it sees Heidegger pushing us intentionally toward confusion. As such, the ‘awakening’ I find in Heidegger’s work is an awakening to confusion: more than he wants to defend any particular position, or demonstrate any particular proposition, Heidegger wants his readers (and, really, ‘the West’ as a whole) to face themselves up to a <em>mystery</em>: namely, ‘the one mystery’ of being itself.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>‘Dasein’ enters Heidegger’s work early on, as the being for whom the awakening is possible: Dasein is the only entity for whom being is an issue, and thus it is only Dasein who can face up to the mystery of being. Insofar as Heidegger talks about the ‘meaning’ of being, it would seem that he must consider the being <em>for whom</em> things are meaningful; this is why, in my judgment, his project begins with a focus on Dasein. The mistake of so much scholarship on Heidegger is to subsequently take Dasein as the central concept for <em>all</em> of Heidegger’s work, and thus reduce Heidegger to a theorist of social relations (Dreyfus), a quasi-Kantian transcendental critic (Carman), or a strange philosopher for whom being and meaningfulness (or ‘intelligibility’) are the same thing (Sheehan). This is a profoundly misguided reading which, it seems to me, is founded upon the false assumption that <em>Being and Time</em> is the apex of Heidegger’s work, rather than the introduction to his project. In defence of my reading, we need only look again to the exergue to <em>Being and Time</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>…are we nowadays even perplexed at our inability to understand the expression ‘being’? Not at all. So first of all we must reawaken an understanding for the meaning of this question. The aim of the following treatise is to work out the question of the meaning of <em>“being”</em> and to do so concretely. The provisional aim is the interpretation of <em>time</em> as the possible horizon for any understanding whatsoever of being.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here, in the very first sentences, Heidegger is explicit that his book is only an <em>opening</em>, wherein a question is asked: namely, the question ‘what does “being” mean?’. Now, Heidegger also refers to ‘the interpretation of <em>time</em>’ as part of the question-asking; in my view, this is the aspect of <em>Being and Time</em> which is most haphazard, and undergoes the greatest transformation and distortion throughout Heidegger’s career. In other words, I grant that his overall project lacks consistency insofar as he initially promises that <em>time</em> will be the horizonal concept of his thinking – as his work progresses, he retains the insistence on a horizon, but does not keep ‘time’ as the mark of this horizon.</p>
<p>So, how is the being-question asked? And – of course we must also ask this – what is its answer? As countless introductions to Heidegger have noted, the issue(s) of ontology first arose in his life when he was gifted a copy of Franz Brentano’s book, <em>On the Manifold Sense of Being in Aristotle</em> (1862). Brentano uses a crucial phrase from Aristotle as the epigraph to his book: <em>Τὸ ὂν λέγεται πολλαχῶς</em>. Heidegger translates this as ‘Das Seiende wird (nämlich hinsichtlich seines Seins) in vielfacher Weise offenkundig’. <em>That which is becomes manifest (with regard to its being) in many ways</em>. This notion, which Heidegger stays true to throughout his whole career, is manifest in his work in two ways:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Ways of being: just like Aristotle, Heidegger recognises that there are different ways or modes of being. For Aristotle, these are fourfold: accidental being, being as truth, being as potentiality or actuality, and categorial being. Heidegger does not enumerate the modes of being, but in <em>Being and Time</em> introduces <em>Zuhandenheit</em> and <em>Vorhandenheit</em> as two central modes of the being of non-Dasein entities.</li>
<li>‘Ways, not works’: this phrase of Heidegger’s is given at the beginning of the Gesamtausgabe, and is a partial explanation of the constant changes in Heidegger’s voice. For as long as his questioning is directed toward <em>being</em>, which ‘is manifest in many ways’, so too must Heidegger’s thought be directed in many ways.</li>
</ol>
<p>We can accordingly formulate the being-question as: what is it that unifies all the manifold ways of being? Heidegger’s project – when it is successful – expresses the answer to this question in manifold ways.</p>
<p>The first two elements of Heidegger’s questioning and answering are <em>phenomenology</em> and <em>the ontological difference</em>. (The latter, I would argue, is the central concept in Heidegger’s career, if we must claim that there is such a thing). Heidegger inherited phenomenology from Husserl, but he was not quite so ambitious with it; while, for Husserl, phenomenology ‘was elaborated into a distinctive philosophical position according to a pattern set by Descartes, Kant and Fichte’, for the early Heidegger its primary purpose was as a clue for engaging the being-question.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> Phenomenology is the λόγος of φαίνεσθαι: it is the manifesting of that-which-shows-itself. As Heidegger writes in <em>Being and Time</em>, the “being true” of λόγος is always ἀλήθεια: un-concealing. Phenomenology, as the λόγος of phenomena, must ‘take beings [that are manifest] out of their concealment; to let them be seen as something unconcealed (ἀληθές); to <em>discover</em> them’.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
