<p>The following is an attempt to put my own thoughts on Heidegger, my ‘evaluation’ of his work, into writing. There will be few cited references to secondary texts, but this shouldn’t be taken as an indication that my thoughts are wholly unique: they are, inevitably, informed by interpreters of Heidegger, but in this writing I am not aiming to faithfully reconstruct the work of any of those interpreters.</p>
<p>To start with – how are we to read Heidegger? It would be wrong to read all works of philosophy as mere autobiography; however, it would also be wrong to project a philosopher out of concrete human life and suggest that they were immune from letting their life enter into their thought. Heidegger himself writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Regarding the personality of a philosopher, our only interest is that he was born at a certain time, that he worked, and that he died. The character of the philosopher, and issues of that sort, will not be addressed here.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here, he either forgets or ignores that the thinking of a philosopher – the fact ‘that he worked’ – <em>is</em> an ‘issue of character’. The work of a philosopher is an attempt to <em>overcome</em> oneself; it is the concrete particulars of human life that provoke thought, and it is the task of thought to find the universal in these particulars. This is why studying philosophy is equivalent to studying the history of philosophy: our task is to recognise the tension, the dialectical relationship, between a philosopher’s life and their thought.</p>
<p>In trying to overcome themselves (their finitude, contingency – their life) through philosophy, the philosopher’s thought both <em>is</em> and is <em>not</em> their life.</p>
<p>Importantly, and for this reason, it is wrong to speak of ‘the racism problem in Kant’, or ‘the fascism problem in Heidegger’. The moral-political ‘problem’ is not separable from the philosophical problem of the thinker as a whole; thus there is only <em>‘the Kant problem’</em>, or <em>‘the Heidegger problem’</em>, and so on, in which questions of racism or fascism arise. In separating the life-problems of a thinker from their philosophical work, one has already assumed that the thinker was able to successfully and entirely overcome their life through philosophy. (In general, the incessant division of philosophy into ‘topics’ or ‘issues’ is a bad sign.)</p>
<h3 id="against">Against Dasein</h3>
<p>I understand Heidegger’s project to be calling for a kind of awakening. In the exergue to <em>Being and Time</em>, he invokes the Platonic theme of forgetting: we have <em>forgotten</em> the meaning of being. Moreover, he claims, we have forgotten even to be <em>perplexed</em> by our forgetting! What is perplexion or confusion? It is the affect that arises when one possesses some vague idea of something; an idea which is so buried over, so neutralised and disguised as ‘common sense’, that it is no longer meaningfully questionable. Insofar as <em>Being and Time</em> works towards <em>asking the question of the meaning of being</em>, therefore, it sees Heidegger pushing us intentionally toward confusion. As such, the ‘awakening’ I find in Heidegger’s work is an awakening to confusion: more than he wants to defend any particular position, or demonstrate any particular proposition, Heidegger wants his readers (and, really, ‘the West’ as a whole) to face themselves up to a <em>mystery</em>: namely, ‘the one mystery’ of being itself.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p>‘Dasein’ enters Heidegger’s work early on, as the being for whom the awakening is possible: Dasein is the only entity for whom being is an issue, and thus it is only Dasein who can face up to the mystery of being. Insofar as Heidegger talks about the ‘meaning’ of being, it would seem that he must consider the being <em>for whom</em> things are meaningful; this is why, in my judgment, his project begins with a focus on Dasein. The mistake of so much scholarship on Heidegger is to subsequently take Dasein as the central concept for <em>all</em> of Heidegger’s work, and thus reduce Heidegger to a theorist of social relations (Dreyfus), a quasi-Kantian transcendental critic (Carman), or a strange philosopher for whom being and meaningfulness (or ‘intelligibility’) are the same thing (Sheehan). This is a profoundly misguided reading which, it seems to me, is founded upon the false assumption that <em>Being and Time</em> is the apex of Heidegger’s work, rather than the introduction to his project. In defence of my reading, we need only look again to the exergue to <em>Being and Time</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>…are we nowadays even perplexed at our inability to understand the expression ‘being’? Not at all. So first of all we must reawaken an understanding for the meaning of this question. The aim of the following treatise is to work out the question of the meaning of <em>“being”</em> and to do so concretely. The provisional aim is the interpretation of <em>time</em> as the possible horizon for any understanding whatsoever of being.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here, in the very first sentences, Heidegger is explicit that his book is only an <em>opening</em>, wherein a question is asked: namely, the question ‘what does “being” mean?’ He is not asking what Dasein means, and it is evident throughout the book that the analysis of Dasein – which, after all, is an analysis of <em>us</em> – is simply a way of opening us up to the mystery of being. In this way, <em>Being and Time</em> is something of a transcendental work, in the Kantian sense of the term. There are multiple ways for Heidegger (in <em>Being and Time</em>) in which <em>Dasein</em> must be interpreted before being itself can be understood. I take these to be the two central aspects of this interpretation:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Dasein has a preontological understanding of being: ‘<em>Seinsverständnis ist selbst eine Seinsebestimmtheit des Daseins</em>’. This serves as a starting point for the being-question, which can be properly asked when Dasein’s preontological understanding is properly developed: ‘the question of being is nothing else than the radicalization of an essential tendency of being that belongs to Dasein itself, namely, of the pre-ontological understanding of being’.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a></li>
<li>Dasein is always at risk of distorting or covering up its understanding of being, thanks to the natural proclivity toward <em>idle talk</em>: a form of discourse wherein Dasein conceals its own being (its being-in-the-world) under the comfort of everyday chatter. In its idle talk, Dasein ‘holds any new questioning [e.g. of being] and discussion at a distance because it presumes it has understood, and in a peculiar way it suppresses them and holds them back’.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a></li>
</ol>
<p>Put this way, the early Heidegger is not nearly as radical as he will become: is there not a close similarity between Heidegger’s laying the ground of the being-question through an interpretation of Dasein, and Kant’s laying the ground of critical metaphysics through an interpretation of the transcendental ego? I don’t mean to suggest that Dasein <em>is</em> the transcendental ego – it is not an ego at all – but that the broad gestures of <em>Being and Time</em> still remain largely within the tradition of Western metaphysics. Indeed, William Richardson – the only Anglo-American Heidegger scholar to receive Heidegger’s explicit approval – characterises <em>Being and Time</em> in the following way:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Heidegger’s purpose is to <em>lay the groundwork for metaphysics</em> by seeking to discern that ontological structure of man which is the source of his natural tendency to metaphysicize. Since metaphysics deals with Being structures and the metaphysician is intrinsically finite, the problem becomes an effort to explain <em>the relation between Being and finitude</em>. Solution: the comprehension of Being as such is intrinsically finite. The function of SZ is to discern phenomenologically this finite comprehension of Being and reveal its ultimate sense.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Laying the groundwork for metaphysics… the relation between Being and finitude… these are undoubtedly classical themes in Western philosophy. It is for this reason that I take the role of <em>Being and Time</em> (and its core concept of Dasein) in Heidegger’s complete corpus to be akin to Wittgenstein’s metaphor of a ladder: <em>Being and Time</em> awakens us, hopefully, to the mystery of being (the discovery of the ontological difference is enough to do this, really), but it is ultimately to be discarded once the reader recognises it as caught up within a metaphysical tradition which, for Heidegger, is ultimately to be overcome.</p>
<p>Now, Heidegger also refers to ‘the interpretation of <em>time</em>’ as part of the question-asking; this, too, is an element of his work that undergoes a lot of change as he moves away from Dasein. Time in <em>Being and Time</em>, compared to later writings, is reasonably small-scale: time is the horizon of being insofar as it limits Dasein’s possibilities and conditions the meaningfulness of ready-to-hand beings. Eventually, Heidegger comes to focus not on the history of <em>beings</em>, but of being itself: all of history, Heidegger will claim, has progressed via the succession of being disclosing itself in various ways. As he writes in 1942, ‘“Time” in <em>Being and Time</em> is not the last but, instead, the first step of the passageway into the transition to the truth of beyng, the transition necessary for the history of beyng.’<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> Yet again, it is made clear that <em>Being and Time</em>, and the analysis of Dasein, was merely a stepping-stone, a preliminary moment in our opening to the mystery of being.</p>
<h3 id="ways">From Phenomenology to Gelassenheit</h3>
<p>So, how is the being-question asked? And – of course we must also ask this – what is its answer? As countless introductions to Heidegger have noted, the issue(s) of ontology first arose in his life when he was gifted a copy of Franz Brentano’s book, <em>On the Manifold Sense of Being in Aristotle</em> (1862). Brentano uses a crucial phrase from Aristotle as the epigraph to his book: τὸ ὂν λέγεται πολλαχῶς. Heidegger translates this as ‘Das Seiende wird (nämlich hinsichtlich seines Seins) in vielfacher Weise offenkundig’. <em>That which is becomes manifest (with regard to its being) in many ways</em>. This notion, which Heidegger stays true to throughout his whole career, is manifest in his work in two ways:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Ways of being: just like Aristotle, Heidegger recognises that there are different ways or modes of being. For Aristotle, these are fourfold: accidental being, being as truth, being as potentiality or actuality, and categorial being. Heidegger does not enumerate the modes of being, but in <em>Being and Time</em> introduces <em>Zuhandenheit</em> and <em>Vorhandenheit</em> as two central modes of the being of non-Dasein entities.</li>
<li>‘Ways, not works’: this phrase of Heidegger’s is given at the beginning of the Gesamtausgabe, and is a partial explanation of the constant changes in Heidegger’s voice. For as long as his questioning is directed toward <em>being</em>, which ‘is manifest in many ways’, so too must Heidegger’s thought be directed in many ways.</li>
</ol>
<p>We can accordingly formulate the being-question as: what is it that unifies all the manifold ways of being? Heidegger’s project – when it is successful – expresses the answer to this question in manifold ways.</p>
<p>The first two elements of Heidegger’s <strong>questioning</strong> are <em>phenomenology</em> and <em>the ontological difference</em>. (The latter, I would argue, is the central concept in Heidegger’s career, if we must claim that there is such a thing). Heidegger inherited phenomenology from Husserl, but he was not quite so ambitious with it; while, for Husserl, phenomenology ‘was elaborated into a distinctive philosophical position according to a pattern set by Descartes, Kant and Fichte’, for the early Heidegger its primary purpose was as a clue for engaging the being-question.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> Phenomenology is the λόγος of φαίνεσθαι: it is the manifesting of that-which-shows-itself. As Heidegger writes in <em>Being and Time</em>, the “being true” of λόγος is always ἀλήθεια: un-concealing. Phenomenology, as the λόγος of phenomena, must ‘take beings [that are manifest] out of their concealment; to let them be seen as something unconcealed (ἀληθές); to <em>discover</em> them’.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a></p>
<p>The ontological difference is what makes Heidegger’s work so revolutionary (and also difficult). It is an observation that is easy to state but difficult to comport one’s thinking around. The ‘doctrine’ of ontological difference states that <em>there is a difference between beings and being itself</em>. In other words, ‘being’ – that which qualifies things <em>as things</em> – is not itself a thing. It would be a grave error to hear this and subsequently render Heidegger as a kind of Platonist, for whom every thing is indebted in its essence to something more universal; for, in Plato, the forms or ideas are still, nonetheless, things. Indeed – and here is the radical core of Heidegger’s thinking – the fact that being is not <em>a being</em> is what makes it completely elusive to the realm of propositional or definitional discourse: as Pascal had already realised, ‘One cannot undertake to define being without falling into this absurdity; for one cannot define a word without beginning in this way: <em>“It is …”</em>’<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a></p>
<p>These primary philosophical elements of Heidegger’s – phenomenology and the ontological difference – are united to reveal the precise way in which the being-question is to be <strong>answered:</strong> not by asserting a proposition or a definition, which would remain trapped in the ontic sphere (i.e. the sphere of beings, things, entities), but to <em>let</em> being be <em>unconcealed</em> to us. Throughout all of Heidegger’s ‘ways, not works’, it is this strategy, I argue, that remains ever-present. When he makes use of the concept of <em>Gelassenheit</em> in his later work, for instance, we still see the motif of <em>letting</em> [<em>lassen</em>] being <em>be</em>. When he increases his focus on poetry in the thirties, he is consciously aware of the capacity of poetic language to <em>let things be</em>, and allow a world to come into unconcealment. This is illustrated well by Angelus Silesius’s poem, which Heidegger was so fond of:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>The rose is without ‘why’;<br> It blooms simply because it blooms;<br> It pays no attention to itself,<br> Nor does it ask whether anyone sees it.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>As I understand it, this recurring approach in Heidegger’s thinking – for which, in my view, the term <em>Gelassenheit</em> serves as a useful synecdoche (along with the linguistic concept of the middle voice) – is the inevitable consequence of thinking the ontological difference. That is to say, it is the inevitable outcome of Heidegger’s orientation at the outset. Ordinary language (which Heidegger is so hostile towards, along with most other facets of ‘common sense’) is overwhelmingly ‘ontic’: to speak or write in a representational register is to rely on subjects, predicates, and an infinity of <em>things</em>, without any regard for the <em>being</em> of those things. It is no wonder that Carnap had to entirely reject Heidegger’s writing about <em>das Nichts</em>: as Hegel recognised over a century prior to Carnap and Heidegger, ‘the nothing’ (as well as being itself) is no-thing, i.e., no entity. The alternative mode of thinking that remains is to eschew all common sense and, instead, work in an often poetic register, a state of Gelassenheit, hoping that language will not ‘present’ but ‘reveal’ the truth of being, as though we, the thinkers, are bestowed with a gift.</p>
<h3 id="being-historical-thinking">Being-Historical Thinking</h3>
<p>The failure of the entire history of philosophy, according to Heidegger, is its self-entrapment within <em>ontotheology</em>. This word gained its first notable use in Kant, who also used it disparagingly, but it takes on an entirely new meaning in Heidegger’s work. In his middle and later writings, Heidegger accuses all metaphysical thinking of operating in a twofold manner: a twofold way of avoiding the being-question. Instead of looking for the ‘meaning’ or ‘truth’ of being, Heidegger explains, metaphysics has looked to explain two ontic phenomena: (1) the <em>essence</em> of things (their ‘whatness’), and (2) the <em>existence</em> of things as a whole (their ‘thatness’). These two investigations constitute the ‘onto’ and ‘theo’ of ontotheology; as Heidegger writes in <em>Kant’s Thesis About Being</em>,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[Metaphysics] asks on the one hand: What are beings, in general, as beings? Considerations within the province of this question come, in the course of the history of philosophy, under the heading of ontology. The question “What are beings?” includes also the question, “Which being is the highest and in what way is it?” The question is about the divine and God. The province of this question is called theology.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>For Heidegger, therefore, it is no coincidence that Western metaphysics is abound with dualisms: essence-existence, content-form, and so on.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> These dualisms are simply manifestations of metaphysics’ twofold operation, and they all show a dedication to ground metaphysics in some transhistorical presence, in some entity that is somehow prior to, or more fundamental than, all others. As Heidegger writes in his <em>Contributions to Philosophy</em>,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The more exclusively thinking turns toward beings and seeks for itself a foundation that <em>is</em> most eminently (cf. Descartes and the modern era), all the more decisively does philosophy withdraw from the truth of beyng.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>When Heidegger carries out his critique of ontotheology, from the 1930s until the end of his life, he will conversely look to the <em>history</em> of being. In the earlier work, Heidegger acknowledged the historical temporality of beings (including Dasein). From the thirties and onwards, therefore, he envisions this earlier work as too metaphysical, since its concern lay with the historicity of beings, rather than the history of being itself. The historicising of ontology is really what constitutes the ‘turning’ that his thought is said to have undergone.</p>
<p>Let’s look at this turning, step-by-step. <em>Being and Time</em> is published in 1927, and is followed by <em>Kant und das Problem der Metaphysik</em> in 1929. The latter is, more or less, a continuation of the former’s project: Heidegger reads Kant as laying the ground for metaphysics. In July of 1930, he gives a lecture entitled ‘On the Essence of Truth’, in which he claims that the essence of truth is found in ‘letting beings be’.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> In a later note on this essay, he admits that, in <em>Being and Time</em>, ‘thinking apparently remains on the pass of metaphysics’.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> The lecture on truth sees the first suggestion of a movement away from Dasein and toward being itself – namely, being as truth or ἀλήθεια.</p>
<p>In April 1933, Heidegger was chosen as the rector of Freiburg university, and he joined the Nazi party less than two weeks later. By this time, he was already denouncing an ‘international Jewish conspiracy’ to his friends (such as Karl Jaspers), and endorsing the Nazi government’s anti-Semitic activity. In my view, the Rectoral Address that Heidegger gave in this year is of particular use to us: it not only reveals the nature of his nazism, not only introduces his turn to historical thinking, but also suggests that these two phenomena might be linked. The Address does not contain reference to ‘the Führer’, ‘Hitler’, or even ‘National Socialism’; however, it contains frequent reference to ‘<em>our</em> Dasein’, and the historical ‘fate of the German people’.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> For Heidegger, the university is an essential component of a state that wishes to assert itself; the role of university education is to ‘educate and discipline the leaders and guardians of the fate of the German people’ by reaching self-knowledge through an examination of ‘the essence of science’.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> It is in this context, I argue, that his turn to historical thinking comes about; he himself makes an explicit link between historico-philosophical thinking and the ‘science’ that allows for a German ‘Volk’ to assert itself:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>But if there is to be science, and if it is to be <em>for</em> us and <em>through</em> us, under what conditions can it then truly exist?</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Only if we again place ourselves under the power of the <em>beginning</em> of our spiritual-historical being [<em>Dasein</em>]. This beginning is the setting out of Greek philosophy. Here, for the first time, western man raises himself up from a popular base and, by virtue of his language, stands up to the <em>totality of what is</em>, which he questions and conceives as the being that it is.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>There is a lot to be said about this declaration. Firstly, the middle-voiced tendency in Heidegger – the spirit of <em>Gelassenheit</em> – is evident in his depiction of science working ‘<em>through</em> us’, and of the people placing themselves ‘under the power of’ their Dasein. Secondly, Heidegger is here explicit in saying that in order to ‘stand up to’ being, ‘western man’ must traverse back to the ‘beginning’, in Greek philosophy. He will later write extensively on <em>der andere Anfang</em> (the other beginning), which for him marks the future of philosophy after its renewal of <em>der erste Anfang</em> (the first beginning) in Greek philosophy. I would suggest that this is not just naïve eurocentrism, but in fact a deliberate philosophical gesture that coincides with Heidegger’s growing fascist politics. Is it a mere coincidence that Heidegger’s calls for a new beginning of thought, informed by the first beginning in ancient Greece, come at the same time as the Nazis’ call for a revolutionary new beginning in European society? Could it be that Heidegger’s turn to historical thinking was in some way informed by, or paying service to, the Nazi conception of ‘fate’ and revolution?</p>
