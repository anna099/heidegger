<h3 id="a-commentary-on-the-text">A Commentary on the Text</h3>
<p><em>Being and Time</em> is a 1927 book by Heidegger, and it is typically seen as his magnum opus. The book has no subtitle, but in its exergue Heidegger describes it as a ‘treatise … to work out the question of the meaning of <em>“being”</em> and to do so concretely.’<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> The book is unfinished, and made up of two ‘divisions’ of six chapters each. In its totality, the text is split into 83 numbered sections. This commentary will be divided on the same basis.</p>
<h1 id="section" class="btsec">§1</h1>
<p>Heidegger says that the ‘Question of Being’ has been forgotten. He makes some really interesting and cool points about what things are and what they mean.</p>
