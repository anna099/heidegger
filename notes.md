From SZ into the later work, analysis of the historicity of Dasein gives way to
an analysis of general ontological historicity.

SZ was too tied up with metaphysical language and idioms -- the consistent
misinterpretation of Heidegger attests to this.

As such, his middle period becomes incredibly obscure, solitary, and meditative.
*Ereignis* takes the stage after *Dasein*, as a concept that is closer to the
unconcealing of being and further from ontotheology.

In keeping with the theme of letting being be, Heidegger's middle period is
characterised by a theme of meditative listening 'in a mode of silence'
(*Heidegger's Nonpublic Writings*); the writings are far more performative than
the early texts.

'History is not taken here as one domain of beings among other domains; instead,
it exclusively has in view the essential occurrence of beyng itself.'
