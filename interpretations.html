<h3 id="taylor-carman">Taylor Carman</h3>
<p>In Taylor Carman’s book <em>Heidegger’s Analytic</em>,<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> he argues, on the grounds of Heidegger’s declaration that ’<em>Only as phenomenology, is ontology possible’</em> (SZ 35), that the analysis of Dasein is the centre of Heidegger’s whole project:</p>
<h1 id="section" class="btsec">9</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>Philosophy begins in wonder, Plato and Aristotle say, and in the course of his inquiry into the meaning of being, Heidegger can fairly be credited with reminding modern philosophy of what may be the most wondrous fact of all – that there <em>is</em> anything, and moreover that we understand something definite, however obscure, in understanding that there is.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Carman claims that Heidegger is engaged in something of a transcendental project, and that the decision to pursue ontology through Dasein is analogous to Kant’s decision to pursue his critique of metaphysics through an analysis of the faculties that attempt metaphysics:</p>
<h1 id="section-1" class="btsec">10</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>[There is] an unmistakable analogy between Heidegger’s fundamental ontology in <em>Being and Time</em> and the “Copernican revolution” in philosophy Kant claimed to have brought about in the <em>Critique of Pure Reason</em>.</p>
</blockquote>
<h1 id="section-2" class="btsec">11</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>Just as, for Kant, human reason is burdened with questions that it can neither dismiss nor answer, so too, for Heidegger, Dasein is in under constant, if at times only subtle, threat of diversion and temptation away from a proper “authentic” (<em>eigentlich</em>) understanding of itself.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The intended result of Heidegger’s transcendental inquiry, Carman explains, is not the conditions of knowledge, as it was for Kant, but instead the conditions for interpretation – most especially, the interpretation of beings.</p>
<h1 id="section-3" class="btsec">12</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>So, just as Kant is concerned not with the empirical contents of our beliefs, but with the subjective conditions of knowledge, Heidegger, I shall argue, is interested not in our particular practices and understandings, but in the conditions of the possibility of interpretation (<em>Auslegung</em>). Interpretation, for Heidegger, means explicit understanding, making sense of something <em>as</em> something – primitively <em>entities as entities</em>, that is, as <em>being</em>. According to Heidegger, then, the question of the meaning of being, the question concerning what we understand when we understand entities <em>as entities</em>, presupposes some general account of our ability to understand anything explicitly as anything. So, while Henry Allison has construed Kant’s transcendental idealism as an account of “epistemic conditions,” or conditions of knowledge, I read Heidegger’s fundamental ontology as an account of what I shall call <em>hermeneutic conditions</em>, that is, conditions of interpretation or explicit understanding.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The primary difference between Kantian epistemic conditions and Heideggerian hermeneutic conditions is, for Carman, that the latter profess no independence from the hermeneutic being itself (namely, Dasein):</p>
<h1 id="section-4" class="btsec">23</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>the point of fundamental ontology is precisely to deny any sense of ontological commitment independent of an account of our own everyday, preontological understanding of being.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Once Carman has established an outline of his reading, he reveals the crux of his interpretation of Heidegger: namely, that Heidegger is an ‘externalist’, in the tradition of analytic philosophers such as Putnam and Kripke, distinguished from these other writers by his focus on <em>social</em> externalities, as opposed to <em>physical</em> ones:</p>
<h1 id="section-5" class="btsec">137</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>Simply put, on my reading, Heidegger is a social externalist, not a physical externalist. That is, although he locates the constitutive conditions of intentionality out in the world, rather than in our heads, he does not take for granted any specialized descriptions of the external world drawn from the natural sciences. Instead, on his account, the world that has authority over the contents of our intentional attitudes is not the physical world itself, but the social world, that is, the world of human customs and institutions made accessible to us by our ordinary shared normative standards of intelligibility.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Perhaps the most egregious instance of Carman’s transformation of Heidegger into an analytic philosopher is his insistence that Heidegger is an ‘ontic realist’, committed to a kind of ‘metaphysical common sense’:</p>
<h1 id="section-6" class="btsec">134</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>To say that Heidegger is an <em>ontic realist</em>, then, is to say that, although he maintains that cognition is founded on being-in, and that occurrent reality is interpretable for us only against the horizon of our own worldliness, which constitutes a practical context of hermeneutic conditions, occurrent entities themselves nevertheless do not depend on Dasein’s being-in-the-world.</p>
</blockquote>
<h1 id="section-7" class="btsec">136</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>[Heidegger’s] phenomenology is an account of the categories by which we do in fact make sense of things, so his account of our interpretations of entities as occurrent is precisely an account of our understanding of them as existing independently of that understanding. This fidelity to a kind of metaphysical common sense is at the heart of what I shall call Heidegger’s <em>ontic realism</em>.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="sheehan">Thomas Sheehan</h3>
<p>Thomas Sheehan (1941-) is an American professor of Religious Studies and German philosophy. He was a student of William J. Richardson, whose work inaugurated the ‘classical paradigm’ of Heidegger interpretation (i.e., that which holds ‘Being itself’ to be the central concern of Heidegger’s philosophical career); however, Sheehan’s main text on Heidegger, entitled <em>Making Sense of Heidegger: A Paradigm Shift</em>, claims to institute an updated and more accurate reading of Heidegger’s work.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> For Sheehan, Heidegger scholarship in the English language has been dominated by two ‘paradigms’: firstly, the <em>existentialist</em> reading that understood Heidegger primarily as the influence on French existentialism (Sartre, Merleau-Ponty, etc.), focused on human being in its various modes of existence: angst, authenticity, and so on. Secondly, the work of Richardson (and also Otto Pögeller, whose <em>Martin Heidegger’s Path of Thinking</em> was translated into English in 1987) brought about a more strictly <em>ontological</em> reading of Heidegger’s work, seeing the analysis of human being as only a step towards the understanding of being as such. In <em>Making Sense</em>, Sheehan draws from thousands of citations in the <em>Gesamtausabe</em> to make the claim that, for his entire career’s work, Heidegger was not focused on ‘being’ (in the typical sense of the word, i.e. that in virtue of which things <em>are</em>), but instead on the ‘meaningful presence’ [<em>Anwesen</em>] of beings. When Heidegger uses the term ‘Sein’, Sheehan argues, he is in fact referring not to the mere existence of entities (Vorhandenheit), but to the way in which these entities <em>can be meaningful</em> to us.</p>
<p>In <em>Making Sense</em>, Sheehan takes note of how Heidegger’s ‘philosophical evolution’ began with an interest in Aristotle; specifically, in Aristotle’s investigation into the question: ‘What is a thing?’ The unique element of Heidegger’s thought came about when he noticed that, in spite of all his metaphysical insight, Aristotle had never asked: ‘What is being itself?’ – that is, what is it that opens itself up to us, and grounds things in their being? Sheehan argues that Heidegger finds the answer to this latter question in Parmenides, who refers (in F1.29) to ‘well-rounded ἀλήθεια’ as that which makes any account of being possible. The task of Heidegger’s work, according to Sheehan, is therefore located two steps beyond the mere things of Aristotle’s metaphysics: Aristotle asked ‘how come there are beings?’ – a question to which the obvious answer is: being. Then follows the question, ‘how come there “is” being?’, which – for Sheehan’s Heidegger – is answered by the clearing [<em>Lichtung</em>] that was implied by Parmenides. For Heidegger, the question is therefore: how is it that there is this clearing? He aims to identify ‘that wherein being has its emergence and its openness (clearing – disclosing) – in fact, wherein openness itself has its own emergence.’ (GA 73). Seeing that it is two steps away from Aristotle’s work, Sheehan identifies Heidegger’s thought as meta-metaphysics. This understanding is defended by reference to the following quotation from Heidegger, in his preface to the 1930 Japanese translation of ‘What is Metaphysics?’:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>‘As such, the author believes to have recognised that the more original elaboration of the traditional guiding-question of Western metaphysics – “what is a being?” – is supported and led by the grounding-question, “what is being?”. With this question, it is also asked: what grounds the inner possibility and necessity of the openness of being?’ (GA 16, p. 66. Sheehan’s translation).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Central to Sheehan’s reading of Heidegger is the claim that Dasein <em>is</em> the clearing: as the being for which other beings are meaningful, Dasein is the ground of meaningfulness. From <em>Being and Time</em> onwards, therefore, Heidegger can be seen as part of the transcendental tradition that starts with Descartes and is revolutionised in Kant. The philosophical procedure of this tradition sees the ‘inquiring subject’ become the ‘subject of inquiry’, as Sheehan puts it. Furthermore, Dasein is in fact ‘the thing itself’ of Heidegger’s inquiry, as Sheehan claims in his essay ‘Dasein’.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> This is because, according to <em>Making Sense</em>, the real notion of ‘being’ that Heidegger’s work was investigating was never something hypostasised and separated from human existence. Being, as meaningful presence, can never be separated from the hermeneutic Dasein who enters a relation with beings-that-can-be-meaningful, and in so doing brings about meaning.</p>
<p>So, if the subject matter of Heidegger’s work is the openness or intelligibility of being [<em>Sinn von Sein</em>], the revolutionary character of Heidegger’s work (so Sheehan argues) is its focus on the ‘correlativity’ of humans and being. It is this focus that makes Heidegger’s ontology <em>phenomenological</em>. Phenomenology ‘regards things only insofar as they are meaningfully present to us within our concerns and performances’, Sheehan claims. Further, he suggests that the <em>only</em> philosophical problems, from the phenomenological perspective, are those of ‘sense, meaning, and signification’. Under this interpretation, Dasein – the open being for whom things are intelligible – is present throughout Heidegger’s work.</p>
<p>In 2018, Sheehan privately published an essay titled ‘Martin Heidegger: Overcoming Metaphysics’. Introducing Heidegger as the German philosopher who – despite being described as an ‘existentialist’ in the first half of the twentieth century – was in fact concerned less with human beings and more with being as such, the essay aims to explain how Heidegger understood being in a non-metaphysical way, precisely by ‘overcoming’ metaphysics. Sheehan opens his exposition with two questions: what is metaphysics, and what does it mean to ‘get free’ of it?</p>
<p>In Aristotle’s work, metaphysics is the ‘queen of the sciences’: it explores the ultimate or highest reality of things, while the ‘particular sciences’ analyse the nature and structure of particular things. For instance, biology explores the contingent nature of contingent living beings, physics analyses particular physical beings and forces, and so on. Metaphysics itself, in Aristotle’s system, is divided in two: ontology (‘general metaphysics’), in Sheehan’s words, ‘deals with what constitutes the ultimate realness’ of the totality of things. Natural theology (‘special metaphysics’) deals with non-material things, particularly and especially <em>God</em> as the ‘highest being’, insofar as such a being can be known through reason and without revelation. This twofold character of metaphysics is what led Heidegger to give it the name <em>ontotheology</em>.</p>
<p>The Aristotelian conception of metaphysics as ontotheology dominated philosophy for many centuries: in the Arabic world, Ibn Sina (980-1037) used Aristotle’s <em>Metaphysics</em> to construct a systematic ontology and theology, and in the following century Ibn Rushd (1126-1198) wrote commentaries on the <em>Metaphysics</em> that brought about the Western renaissance of Aristotelian thought, characterised by the work of Thomas Aquinas (1225-1274). Sheehan also mentions Francisco Suarez, Jean-Baptiste du Hamel, and Christian Wolff as other prominent philosophers of the Aristotelian tradition in the sixteenth, seventeenth, and eighteenth centuries respectively.</p>
<p>So how does Heidegger escape the Aristotelian tradition of ontotheology? For Sheehan, ‘Heidegger’s entire philosophy’ begins this escape with a ‘radically new vision of human being’.</p>
<p>In constructing this ‘vision’, Heidegger emphasises that to be human is to be <em>outside oneself</em>. I am not an internal subject who must reach into the ‘external world’ for experience and ‘drag it back inside’ in order to comprehend it. Rather, I am always already placed alongside the things of the world. In Sheehan’s words, ‘having a soul or mind means living <em>out in the world</em> with whatever we encounter’. Furthermore, Sheehan argues, it is simply the raw <em>things</em> that we are in the world with, but ‘<em>with the meanings</em> of things’. The mind for Heidegger (though he rarely uses this word himself) is not a subjective entity that can choose to ‘experience things’ at a moment’s notice; instead, it is better understood <em>as an act</em>, which is <em>continuously</em> concerned with the things alongside it – and with their meaning. This comes directly from Brentano and Husserl’s teaching that all consciousness is intentional. As Sheehan understands it, the human being for Heidegger is an alethic being, or a hermeneut. Heidegger takes the notion of intentionality or outsideness further, by describing the human being as ‘projected’ [<em>entworfen</em>] and ‘thrown’ [<em>geworfen</em>] into the world (of meaning). As humans, Sheehan explains, we are always within a world; we cannot isolate ourselves within the ‘internal’ mind. Furthermore, as has already been emphasised, the world within which we find ourselves is not just a world of <em>things</em>, but of <em>meaningful</em> things which we are involved and concerned with. (Heidegger uses the word <em>Sorge</em> to refer to this concern).</p>
<p>Sheehan sees the repeated insistence on ‘meaningfulness’ [<em>Bedeutsumkeit</em>] as further evidence of Heidegger’s departure from Aristotle: whereas the Aristotelian system understands the word ‘logos’ [<em>λόγος</em>] as <em>reason</em>, for Sheehan’s Heidegger it denotes the ‘<em>field of meaningfulness</em>’ that ‘illuminates’ everything that the human being experiences. ‘But’, Sheehan writes, ‘this field of meaningfulness is not a “tool” that we “use” … Rather, it is what we <em>are</em>’. That things are ‘lit up’ around us, and able to be interpreted, is <em>constitutive</em> of Heidegger’s human. This very fact, Sheehan claims, is what Heidegger believes ‘metaphysics has overlooked ever since Plato and Aristotle’. Since these two figures saw the dawn of Western philosophy, metaphysics has been concerned with the interaction between ‘subjects’ and ‘objects’, the former being the rational observer, and the latter being the ‘raw matter’ of the universe, a ‘collection of things’. Sheehan argues that Heidegger accuses metaphysics of being ‘ignorant of the open field of meaningfulness <em>that brings subjects and objects together</em> in human knowledge and action’ (my emphasis).</p>
<p>For Heidegger, this ‘open field’ that ontotheology has disregarded is called <em>the clearing</em> [<em>die Lichtung</em>, from ‘licht’ for ‘light’].</p>
<p>The clearing was not overlooked by ontotheological metaphysics out of mere stupidity. Instead, Sheehan explains, it was overlooked because of a kind of paradox that it confronts us with: how are we to understand that which makes our understanding possible? To do so would be like jumping over one’s own shadow. The clearing thus remains ‘<em>intrinsically hidden</em>’ as it makes all encounters of that which is <em>un-hidden</em> possible. Heidegger thus arrives, by different reasoning, to St. Augustine’s conclusion that ‘human being is fundamentally a mystery to itself, a bottomless abyss (<em>homo abyssus est</em>)’. The overlooking of the mystery of human being causes us to be alienated from ourselves. Though my own existence is the closest thing to me (precisely because it is <em>what I am</em>), it is also the <em>furthest</em>, since it is so concealed from me. Sheehan claims that, for Heidegger, the domineering <em>technicity</em> that is seen in Western culture is a consequence of the overlooking of the clearing.</p>
<p>If the clearing is intrinsically hidden from us, how are we to relate to it? Sheehan argues that the ‘unfathomable fact’ of the human being as clearing is ‘fundamentally the same’ as the <em>present</em> fact that I can die at any moment: the fact of mortality that pervades through much of <em>Being and Time</em>. My mortality permeates my existence as the constant <em>presence</em> of an ultimate <em>absence</em>. ‘In that sense’, Sheehan says, ‘we are virtually “dead already”.’ However, an embracing of this mysterious fact is, for Heidegger, the way towards living <em>authentically</em> [<em>eigentlich</em>]. This sounds promising: a seemingly abstract task – that of overcoming ontotheology by way of embracing the mystery of a hidden clearing – might give way to a concrete vision of how to live one’s life. Unfortunately, Sheehan points out, ‘Heidegger admits he has nothing to say about how to concretely live out such an appropriation of ourselves’. At least in Sheehan’s reading, there is no ethical dimension to Heidegger’s thought.</p>
<p>Sheehan concludes his essay by making a comparison between Heidegger and Kant. In the <em>Critique of Pure Reason</em>, Kant was not merely ‘against’ metaphysics; in fact, he acknowledged the existence of ‘metaphysics as a natural predisposition’ (B 22), wherein humans are predisposed to ask questions that they cannot answer. For Sheehan, this is similar to how Heidegger characterises the human being as inevitably coming up against the clearing (which, after all, is what makes experience possible in the first place), and yet unable to actually <em>comprehend</em> this clearing. But while Kant’s response was to put aside that which we cannot cognise, and systematically account for what we <em>can</em> know, Heidegger’s approach is ‘to urge one to embrace and live from out of that mysterious fact [of the clearing]’. Heidegger’s <em>overcoming</em> of metaphysics, therefore, actually takes form as a journey ‘beneath’ metaphysics, to the fundamental constitution of <em>oneself</em> that is both nearest and furthest from us.</p>
<h4 id="the-sheehan-farin-dialogue">The Sheehan-Farin Dialogue</h4>
<p>In 2016, the Australian philosopher Ingo Farin published an essay in the 26<sup>th</sup> issue of the journal <em>Parrhesia</em>, entitled ‘A Response to Sheehan’s Attempted Paradigm Shift in Heidegger Studies’. In short, Farin argues that Sheehan’s work fails to instate a new paradigm of Heidegger interpretation, precisely because it fails to correctly understand the whole of Heidegger’s work.</p>
<p>Farin understands <em>Making Sense</em> as a critique of a tendency within Heidegger studies to fall into ‘<em>Sein</em>-ology’ or ‘crypto-metaphysics’, wherein being is hypostasised as a ‘supra-human Cosmic Something’, akin to the being of traditional ontotheology. Undoubtedly, it would be wrong to take Heidegger’s being as a new kind of Absolute; however, Farin argues, no respected Heidegger scholar has actually done this. The position that Sheehan promises to critique is, therefore, not a legitimate target. Nonetheless, Sheehan’s critique starts with an affirmation of the intrinsic relation between Sein and Dasein: that is, the ‘reciprocity between being and man’. According to Farin, it would seem that this <em>reciprocity</em> becomes Sheehan’s preferred object to hypostasise, instead of being; consequently, Dasein is given an unprecedented priority in Sheehan’s reading of Heidegger – so much so that, as explained above, being isn’t even the central concern for Sheehan’s Heidegger; instead, Dasein takes centre-stage, and the word ‘being’ is merely shorthand for the <em>meaningful presence</em> of things ‘within the worlds of human interests and concerns’. For Sheehan, therefore, nothing can be said of a being outside of its involvement with Dasein’s (human) affairs. Now, since <em>world</em> is the horizon in which Dasein encounters meaningful things, and (for Sheehan) meaningful presence <em>is</em> being, world is the ‘equivalent to being’. At this point, we see the first shortcoming of Sheehan’s work; namely, that he conflates multiple distinct concepts in Heidegger’s thought: for Sheehan, world, meaningfulness, being, Lichtung, thrownness, ‘the open’, and Ereignis are all various ways of expressing the same thing. The ‘focal meaning’ of this same thing, as Farin sees it, is Dasein. To this end, Sheehan claims that ‘Heidegger’s philosophy in a nutshell’ can be expressed with one sentence: ‘Metaphorically speaking, as thrown-open (i.e., appropriated), human being is the “open space” or clearing within which the meaningful presence of things can occur.’</p>
<p>This, however, takes us to a second critique of Sheehan’s work. Though he claims that Dasein is the central figure of Heidegger’s entire career (and that whenever it isn’t, Heidegger has simply made a mistake; the being-historical texts, for example, are dismissed as ‘outside the pale of serious discussion’), Sheehan seems to reduce Dasein to a pure Cartesian ego. As Farin notes, Dasein is correctly interpreted by Sheehan as an inherently hermeneutic being; however, he claims, ‘for Sheehan “being hermeneutical” means nothing more than the levelled-down idea that we as humans happen “to make sense” of things’. As such, Heidegger’s ‘anti-Cartesian and historical dimension opened up by hermeneutics’ is lost. More explicitly, Sheehan himself identifies the ineluctable hermeneusis of human being as ‘the unavoidable truth of Descartes’ <em>ego cogito</em>’. Thus, despite equating Dasein with the world and the clearing, Sheehan has rendered his Dasein to be a timeless, placeless subjectivity – directly contradicting Heidegger’s project.</p>
<p>What is the result of Sheehan’s equating Dasein, the worldly hermeneut, with the disembodied subjectivity of modernity? Again, it is a direct contradiction of Heidegger’s work; in this instance, of Heidegger’s anti-modernism. ‘Modern subjectivity’, Sheehan writes, ‘is a glorious fact that should be celebrated, along with all its humanizing achievements, including calculative thinking, scientific discoveries, and technological advances. [… Heidegger’s thought] in no way puts the brakes on such achievements’. As Farin correctly points out, this sentiment is one that was passionately challenged by Heidegger, from <em>Being and Time</em> to the <em>Black Notebooks</em>.</p>
<p>If Farin’s essay is correct, then <em>Making Sense</em> has failed to bring about a paradigm shift in the reading of Heidegger. Instead, Sheehan has to a great extent assimilated Heidegger’s work into a much less contentious project; the writings outside of <em>Being and Time</em> (particularly those on the event and the fourfold) are rejected as unnecessary distortions of the earlier work, and the centrality of being is replaced with a focus on human subjectivity as the ground of (subjective) meaningful presence.</p>
<p>In the 29<sup>th</sup> issue of <em>Parrhesia</em>, Sheehan responded to Farin in an essay entitled ‘Which Heidegger? A Response to Ingo Farin’. The paper was given this title since, according to Sheehan, Farin’s criticisms must have come from the fact that each of them were reading ‘different Heideggers’. ‘Which Heidegger?’ makes an attempt to re-defend the thesis that Sein is not, in fact, ‘the core of Heidegger’s thought’. In doing so, Sheehan cites two passages (in the <em>Heraclitus Seminar</em> and the <em>Four Seminars</em>) wherein Heidegger claims that his work has no more ‘use’, no more ‘room’, for ‘the word <em>Sein</em>’. As Sheehan points out, even William J. Richardson – the original defender of the centrality of being to Heidegger’s thought – notes that the word <em>Sein</em> ‘has almost completely disappeared from [the later Heidegger’s] vocabulary’. The argument of <em>Making Sense</em>, therefore, was that ‘Sein’ was merely a provisional term in the journey towards meaningful presence, just as mere ‘presence’ was once a provisional term for being. Sheehan’s project is therefore one of <em>making</em> <em>distinctions</em>, as he himself insists; Farin’s criticism therefore fails on behalf of its failure to recognise these distinctions. The majority of ‘Which Heidegger?’ is therefore a clarification of (seven) different distinctions.</p>
<p>Firstly, Sheehan recognises a distinction in Heidegger between Sein as the being of beings [<em>Sein des Seienden</em>] and Sein as the <em>clearing</em> [<em>Lichtung</em>] that makes the being of beings possible; this is the first distinction, he argues, that Farin overlooked. As such, though Farin is correct (according to Sheehan) to recognise the correlativity between being and human being, he never specifies <em>which</em> being he refers to; consequently, his entire critique is hindered by this ambiguity.</p>
<p>Secondly, Farin has supposedly overlooked the difference between ‘metaphysical <em>Sein</em> and phenomenological <em>Anwesen</em>’. To do so is not only to deny the central thesis of <em>Making Sense</em> (namely, that Sein is a provisional term for the meaningful presence of things in the contexts of human concern), but also to deny ‘Heidegger’s own position throughout the half-century of his career’. Sheehan claims to find evidence of Heidegger’s doctrine that being is subjective, phenomenal presence in a text that Farin himself translated (<em>The Concept of Time</em>), where Heidegger writes, for example, that our ‘surrounding world is present [<em>anwesend</em>] not as a thing-like object [<em>Dingobjekt</em>] but as significance [<em>Bedeutsamkeit</em>]’. Likewise, in <em>Being and Time</em> (for instance, at 74.31-34) Heidegger identifies Vorhandenheit and Zuhandenheit – categories of meaningful presence – as the <em>being</em> of various beings; not merely as imposed pragmatic labels. In ignoring this fact, Farin is therefore ignoring the consistently and necessarily <em>phenomenological</em> character of Heidegger’s ontology.</p>
<h3 id="stambaugh">Joan Stambaugh</h3>
<p>Stambaugh uses her introduction to Heidegger’s <em>On Time and Being</em> to outline how Heidegger’s later work marks a change from his earlier work (i.e., in <em>Being and Time</em>).<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> The name of the lecture – ‘Time and Being’ – suggests that Heidegger has in some way reversed the work he carried out in <em>Being and Time</em>. However, Stambaugh claims, the reality is more complicated: the ‘concepts’ of Heidegger’s early work find themselves transformed in <em>Time and Being</em>, but the original intentions behind them remain intact.</p>
<p>What are these concepts? What is this intention? In <em>Being and Time</em>, Stambaugh says, Heidegger’s project was to move from a phenomenological interpretation of human being toward a fundamental ontology of being as such. In his hermeneutics of human being, Heidegger found that the fundamental character of the human being [<em>Dasein</em>] is <em>being-in-the-world</em>, and that Dasein is always already related to the world by means of ‘care’ [<em>Sorge</em>] – its awareness of things both ready to hand [<em>Zuhanden</em>] and merely ‘present’ [<em>Vorhanden</em>]. Husserl had already thoroughly expanded on the <em>intentionality</em> of human consciousness (i.e., the necessary condition whereby consciousness is always consciousness <em>of something</em>); Heidegger expanded on the <em>way</em> in which Dasein is directed towards these things. The <em>necessity</em> of Dasein’s ‘caring’ – that is, the fact that Dasein is <em>always already</em> aware of, and engaged with, the world – is what shows that there is no worldless subject (as in Descartes).</p>
<p>According to Stambaugh, Heidegger’s description of being-in-the-world was still ‘within the Kantian framework’ of transcendental philosophy. Human being – that is, Dasein – is structured as a ‘caring’ (or ‘concerned’, or ‘aware’) being-in-the-world, and <em>time</em> is the <em>condition of possibility</em> of this caring. Dasein is ‘ekstatic’ – that is, outside of itself – in three ways: past, present, and future. This outsideness-from-itself is what makes Dasein an <em>open</em> being, aware of itself and of other beings that it takes concern with. However, it is this very understanding of temporality that draws Heidegger away from transcendental philosophy (and from traditional philosophy in general), Stambaugh claims. When, at the end of <em>Being and Time</em>, Heidegger suggests that temporality might be the horizon of being, he ‘relinquishes the question of causality and conditions of possibility’, and moves toward an <em>overcoming</em> of all metaphysics and ontology, since ‘[h]orizon has to do with directionality and openness, not with causality’. Looking for fundamental causes or grounds, in the tradition of Kant, is for Heidegger equivalent to theology’s search for the <em>causa sui</em> and <em>summum ens</em>. Thus, all hitherto existing philosophy has been ‘ontotheology’ for Heidegger, and it must be overcome. However, with the end of <em>philosophy</em> comes the task of <em>thinking</em>.</p>
<p>Stambaugh explains that, for Heidegger, non-metaphysical ‘thinking’ is carried out as an analysis of the <em>history</em> of being, which has been pushed along by the event of ‘appropriation’ [<em>Ereignis</em> – also translated as event or ‘enowning’]. Throughout the history of philosophy, Heidegger says, being has been understood in one way or another as <em>presence</em>. The particular kind of presence that being is understood to be has changed not through a dialectical process (as in Hegel), ‘but in sudden epochal transformations which cannot be plotted out in advance’. Stambaugh lists the various kinds of presence that Heidegger identifies in the history of philosophy: the One, the Logos, <em>idea</em>, <em>ousia</em>, <em>energeia</em>, substance, actuality, perception, the monad, objectivity, self-positing in the will of reason, love, spirit, power, and ‘the will to will in the eternal recurrence of the same’. The beginning of metaphysics, Heidegger claims, was in Plato’s separation of being (in the realm of forms) and time (in the <em>becoming</em> of actually existing things); as such, in order to escape metaphysics, Heidegger must think being as ‘other than that which never changes’, and he must think time ‘other than as the perishable, constantly changing realm of existence’. Stambaugh sketches an outline of the way Heidegger handles this twofold task.</p>

<li><p><em>Being</em>: because ‘being’ has been so fundamental to metaphysical terminology, it is used less and less as Heidegger’s work develops. He favours the term Ereignis because, unlike ‘being’, Ereignis does not designate a particular ‘realm’ or totality of things (i.e., it does not seem irrevocably attached to being<em>s</em>); instead, it designates a relation: ‘that of man and Being’. Like Nietzsche, Bergson, and Whitehead, Stambaugh explains, Heidegger’s use of Ereignis shows him to understand being as an activity or process. But <em>unlike</em> the processes described by these other thinkers, Ereignis is non-metaphysical, ‘because in the relationship between man and Being as appropriated to each other, the relation is more fundamental than what is related’.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Time</em>: since Aristotle, metaphysics has understood time as a series of ‘now’ moments that, perplexingly, seem to have no structure (Stambaugh quotes Kant – ‘time has no shape’). The response to this puzzle was to ‘spatialise’ time (presumably as a line), and thereby dismiss the event of ‘occurrence’ by, instead, focusing entirely on the <em>present</em> (or the ‘presents’ as a linear sequence of ‘now’ moments). Heidegger avoids this reduction by moving away from <em>presents</em> and towards <em>presence</em>: future is ‘the withholding of presence’, and past is ‘the refusal of presence’. The two exist in a reciprocal relation. This account is non-metaphysical because it requires no ‘now’ to be present; it thereby thinks <em>presence</em> as such, without recourse to a thing being presented.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Stambaugh concludes with just a clue towards the content of <em>Time and Being</em>: ‘Time is the way in which Appropriation appropriates’. If we can say that ‘there is’ [<em>es gibt</em>] being, then appropriation is the ‘it’ [<em>es</em>] that ‘gives’ [<em>gibt</em>] being.</p>
