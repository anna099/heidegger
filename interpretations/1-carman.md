## Interpretations of Heidegger

### Taylor Carman

In Taylor Carman's book *Heidegger's Analytic*,[^1] he argues, on the grounds of
Heidegger's declaration that '*Only as phenomenology, is ontology possible'* (SZ
35), that the analysis of Dasein is the centre of Heidegger's whole project:

> Philosophy begins in wonder, Plato and Aristotle say, and in the course of his
> inquiry into the meaning of being, Heidegger can fairly be credited with
> reminding modern philosophy of what may be the most wondrous fact of all –
> that there *is* anything, and moreover that we understand something definite,
> however obscure, in understanding that there is.

Carman claims that Heidegger is engaged in something of a transcendental
project, and that the decision to pursue ontology through Dasein is analogous to
Kant's decision to pursue his critique of metaphysics through an analysis of the
faculties that attempt metaphysics:

# 10 {.btsec}

> [There is] an unmistakable analogy between Heidegger’s fundamental ontology in
> *Being and Time* and the "Copernican revolution" in philosophy Kant claimed to
> have brought about in the *Critique of Pure Reason*.

# 11 {.btsec}

> Just as, for Kant, human reason is burdened with questions that it can neither
> dismiss nor answer, so too, for Heidegger, Dasein is in under constant, if at
> times only subtle, threat of diversion and temptation away from a proper
> "authentic" (*eigentlich*) understanding of itself.

The intended result of Heidegger's transcendental inquiry, Carman explains, is
not the conditions of knowledge, as it was for Kant, but instead the conditions
for interpretation -- most especially, the interpretation of beings.

# 12 {.btsec}

> So, just as Kant is concerned not with the empirical contents of our beliefs,
> but with the subjective conditions of knowledge, Heidegger, I shall argue, is
> interested not in our particular practices and understandings, but in the
> conditions of the possibility of interpretation (*Auslegung*).
> Interpretation, for Heidegger, means explicit understanding, making sense of
> something *as* something -- primitively *entities as entities*, that is, as
> *being*. According to Heidegger, then, the question of the meaning of being,
> the question concerning what we understand when we understand entities *as
> entities*, presupposes some general account of our ability to understand
> anything explicitly as anything. So, while Henry Allison has construed Kant's
> transcendental idealism as an account of "epistemic conditions," or conditions
> of knowledge, I read Heidegger’s fundamental ontology as an account of what I
> shall call *hermeneutic conditions*, that is, conditions of interpretation or
> explicit understanding.

The primary difference between Kantian epistemic conditions and Heideggerian
hermeneutic conditions is, for Carman, that the latter profess no independence
from the hermeneutic being itself (namely, Dasein):

# 23 {.btsec}

> the point of fundamental ontology is precisely to deny any sense of
> ontological commitment independent of an account of our own everyday,
> preontological understanding of being.

Once Carman has established an outline of his reading, he reveals the crux of
his interpretation of Heidegger: namely, that Heidegger is an 'externalist', in
the tradition of analytic philosophers such as Putnam and Kripke, distinguished
from these other writers by his focus on *social* externalities, as opposed to
*physical* ones:

# 137 {.btsec}

> Simply put, on my reading, Heidegger is a social externalist, not a physical
> externalist. That is, although he locates the constitutive conditions of
> intentionality out in the world, rather than in our heads, he does not take
> for granted any specialized descriptions of the external world drawn from the
> natural sciences. Instead, on his account, the world that has authority over
> the contents of our intentional attitudes is not the physical world itself,
> but the social world, that is, the world of human customs and institutions
> made accessible to us by our ordinary shared normative standards of
> intelligibility.

Perhaps the most egregious instance of Carman's transformation of Heidegger into
an analytic philosopher is his insistence that Heidegger is an 'ontic realist',
committed to a kind of 'metaphysical common sense':

# 134 {.btsec}

> To say that Heidegger is an *ontic realist*, then, is to say that, although he
> maintains that cognition is founded on being-in, and that occurrent reality is
> interpretable for us only against the horizon of our own worldliness, which
> constitutes a practical context of hermeneutic conditions, occurrent entities
> themselves nevertheless do not depend on Dasein's being-in-the-world.

# 136 {.btsec}

> [Heidegger's] phenomenology is an account of the categories by which we do in
> fact make sense of things, so his account of our interpretations of entities
> as occurrent is precisely an account of our understanding of them as existing
> independently of that understanding. This fidelity to a kind of metaphysical
> common sense is at the heart of what I shall call Heidegger's *ontic realism*.
